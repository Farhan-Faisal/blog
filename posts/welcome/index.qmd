### Introduction 🌟 
In data science, we frequently rely on many packages. With Python, we commonly use libraries such as pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and many others. However, these libraries are often compatible only with specific versions of each other. This is where Conda environments come into play.

### Why Use Conda Environments? 🤔
Conda environments allow us to list all the necessary packages for a project, along with their specific versions, in a single file. This way, when someone else wants to use our project, they can simply install all the required packages from this list, ensuring compatibility.

You might wonder: why do we need environments in the first place? Why can't we just install the packages directly?

The answer is simple: you may have multiple projects, each requiring a different set of packages. One project might need `Python 3.11`, while another requires `Python 3.9`. By using environments, you can maintain separate sets of installed packages and activate the appropriate set depending on the project you are working on.

In the next section, I will show you how to set up an environment file and install a conda environment from an environment file.


### Setting Up Conda Environments 🛠 

**Step 1:** Installing Miniconda
To get started, you need to install Miniconda, a lightweight version of Anaconda that provides just the essentials for managing Conda environments.

Follow the detailed instructions provided [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/install/#quick-command-line-install) for installing Miniconda.

For a quick installation on macOS (ARM64), open your terminal and run the following commands:
```bash
mkdir -p ~/miniconda3
curl https://repo.anaconda.com/miniconda/Miniconda3-latest-MacOSX-arm64.sh -o ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
bash ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh -b -u -p ~/miniconda3
rm ~/miniconda3/miniconda.sh
source ~/miniconda3/bin/activate
conda init --all
```

**Step 2:** Creating the environment file 📝  
In your project folder, create a file named `environment.yaml`.

Open the file and paste the following:

```yaml
name: tutorial
channels:
  - conda-forge
  - defaults
dependencies:
  - numpy=1.26.0
  - pandas=2.2.3
  - pip=24.3.1
  - python=3.11
  - scikit-learn=1.5.2
  - scipy=1.14.1
  - quarto=1.5.57
```

**Step 3: Creating the environemnt from environment.yaml**

While in the directory where the environemnt.yaml is locatied, run:  
```bash
conda env create -f environment.yaml
```

You can then activate the conda environment using:  
```bash  
conda activate tutorial
```

### Going One Step Further: Using Conda Lock Files 🚀 
When you install an environment from an environment file, you might notice that additional packages, which were not explicitly listed, are also installed. For example, when we create the environment from our previous environment file, we see packages like `xx` installed:

![Subdependency Installation](env_install.gif)

Why does this happen? This occurs because in the environment file, we only specify high-level packages.

But when installing a Conda environment across different operating systems, Conda may install different versions of these low-level packages. Consequently, even though the high-level packages remain the same, the overall environment may differ across platforms. Additionally, since we haven't specified exact versions for the low-level dependencies, installing the environment can take longer as Conda needs to resolve compatible versions on its own.

### The Solution? Conda Lock Files 🛡️ 
Conda lock files are platform-specific files that list the exact versions of all dependency packages, including low-level ones, for a given environment. By using these lock files, you can ensure that the environment is identical across different platforms.

In the next section, I will demonstrate how to generate and use Conda lock files to create consistent environments across various operating systems.

### Generating and Using Conda Lock Files 🛠 
Let’s assume we are working with the following environment file (`environment.yaml`):


```yaml
name: tutorial
channels:
  - conda-forge
  - defaults
dependencies:
  - numpy=1.26.0
  - pandas=2.2.3
  - pip=24.3.1
  - python=3.11
  - scikit-learn=1.5.2
  - scipy=1.14.1
  - quarto=1.5.57
```


To generate a lock file for different platforms, run the appropriate command below:


**For macOS (ARM-based, e.g., Apple Silicon):**  

```bash
conda-lock -k explicit -p osx_arm64 -f environment.yaml
```

**For macOS (intel):**  
```bash
conda-lock -k explicit -p osx-64 -f environment.yaml
```

**For Linux:**  
```bash
conda-lock -k explicit -p linux-64 -f environment.yaml
```

**For Windows:**      
```bash
conda-lock -k explicit -p win-64 -f environment.yaml
```

Assuming you are on macOS ARM, you can create an environment from the lock file by running:

```bash
conda-lock install --name tutorial conda-osx-arm64.lock
```

You should generate all four conda lock files to ensure your collaborators have the necessary files for their respective platforms. Running the four commands will produce the following files:

**Note:**  
- The --name flag specifies the environment name (tutorial in this case).
- The lock file ensures the exact versions of dependencies are installed, making the environment fully reproducible across different platforms.

### For Real Pros: Going Even Further  🏅 
Remember when I mentioned that using `conda-lock` allows us to recreate exact environment copies, including exact versions for subdependencies? I wasn’t entirely correct.

While `conda-lock` does pin exact versions of subdependencies, there are certain system or OS-level dependencies that it doesn’t account for. These dependencies can vary depending on the operating system where the environment is created—whether it’s Linux, Windows, or macOS.

This is where Docker comes in. Docker allows us to package an environment along with the OS kernel, such as Linux. Whenever someone runs our Docker container, they’ll be running the project in a Linux environment with the exact same dependencies. By using Docker, we ensure that the project environment is exactly the same for all collaborators, including system-level dependencies.

In the next stage, I’ll guide you through the steps of setting up a Docker container with a copy of your environment from a Linux perspective.

### Docker Steps  🐳 

**Step 1:** Create an account on [DockerHub](https://hub.docker.com)

You need a DockerHub account to manage and store your Docker images. Sign up if you don't already have an account.

**Step 2:** Download and Install [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started/)

**Step 3:** Create the Dockerfile  
Assuming you have the conda-lock file in your working project directory, create a file called `Dockerfile` in your project directory.

```bash
FROM quay.io/jupyter/minimal-notebook:afe30f0c9ad8
COPY conda-linux-64.lock /tmp/conda-linux-64.lock

USER root

# install lmodern for Quarto PDF rendering
RUN sudo apt update \
    && sudo apt install -y lmodern

USER $NB_UID

RUN mamba update --quiet --file /tmp/conda-linux-64.lock \
    && mamba clean --all -y -f \
    && fix-permissions "${CONDA_DIR}"  \
    && fix-permissions "/home/${NB_USER}"
RUN pip install -r /tmp/requirements.txt
```
Briefly,   
- The `FROM` command tells us we are building off an existing environment (Linux, in this case).  
- The `COPY` command is used to transfer your Conda lock file into the Docker container.  
- The `RUN` command installs all the dependencies in the Docker container.  


**Step 4:** Build the Docker Image
```bash
docker build -t username/imagename:tag .

```
- The username should be your DockerHub username.  
- The image name is up to you and can be chosen based on your project or preference.  
- The tag is also your choice and is typically used to version your image (e.g., latest, v1.0, etc.).  

**Step 5:** Push image to Docker Hub
```bash
docker push username/imagename:tag
```

### Using the Docker Image  ⚙️ 

**Step 1:** Create the Docker Compose file in your project directory and name it `docker-compose.yaml`. 

```yaml
services:
  pull-image:
    image: username/imagename:tag
    ports:
      - "8888:8888" 
    volumes:
      - "${PWD}:/app/data" 
    working_dir: /app/data
    deploy:
      resources:
        limits:
          memory: 10G
    platform: linux/amd64
```

**Step 2:** Install docker-compose
```bash
sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/latest/download/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
```

Verify installation using:  
```bash
docker-compose --version
```

**Step 3:** Pull and Run the Docker Image  
In your project directory, run:
```bash
docker-compose up
```  
Follow the instructions on your terminal. That should lead you to a jupyter notebook where you can work on this project inside the docker container.

**Step 4:** Cleanup
After finishing your work, close the Docker container:  
```bash
docker-compose down
```

### Conclusion 🏁 
With this knowledge, you are now ready to collaborate effortlessly with others and ensure that your projects run smoothly on any system. Happy coding!
